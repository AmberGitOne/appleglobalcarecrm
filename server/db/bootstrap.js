 *
 * Two things make that safe. The fast path is two cheap queries - if the
 * schema is there and has users, this returns immediately and never touches
 * the migration runner, so it costs almost nothing on later cold starts.
 * And the slow path runs under an advisory lock, because a deploy's first
 * burst of traffic can cold-start several instances at once and each would
 * otherwise create the same tables.
 *
 * Schema changes after the first deploy are still a deliberate act: this
 * only migrates a database that has no users yet. Run `npm run migrate`
 * against POSTGRES_URL when schema.sql moves forward.
